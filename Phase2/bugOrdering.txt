% bugs while developing ordering

% in my previous code to take user inputs for dish and quantity, I met problems when i entered characters or strings, my code stop and show errors ( which is nearly the same with the problem with phase 1 when i enter phone number.

dish=input("Choose your dishes:");
   % choose dish
   rightDish=0;
   while rightDish==0
       % allow input from 1 to 10
       if dish<1 || dish>10 || dish~=round(dish) 
           disp("Please enter the dish's number again!")
           dish=input("Choose your dishes:");


% My solution was to apply the same method for phase 1, I changed the inputs to string types, and use str2double and is nan to check if inputs are numbers or not while no meeting cracks when input characters or string anymore

dish=input("Choose your dishes:",'s');
   dish=str2double(dish);
   % choose dish
   rightDish=0;
   while rightDish==0
       % allow input from 1 to 10
       if dish<1 || dish>10 || dish~=round(dish) || isnan(dish)
           disp("Please enter the dish's number again!")
           dish=input("Choose your dishes:","s");
           dish=str2double(dish);

% after that there is no cracks and my code ran perfectly

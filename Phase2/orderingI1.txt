% this is a test file for Phase 2, I. Ordering, Part 1: order dishes

*** Phase 2, I. Ordering, Part 2: order quantity share the same idea so i only test Part 1. The only difference is the range for quantity is [1,9]

% customers inputs the number represents a dish, in the range [1,10], in string type. Then i convert it to number by using str2double and store it in an array. I used while loop with str2double and isnan to 
check 3 inputs conditions: 
   + is input a number?
   + is input in the range [1,10]?
   + is input a integer, not decimal?
% the code works if all I can check all 3 conditions, and the output is correct if it meets all conditions.

% in this program "dish" represents dish's number

% Test case 1: input is an integer in the range [1,10]

I expect the output is a vector contain that number

* For example
input: 5
expected output: 5
actual output: 5

% Test case 2: input is an number outside [1,10] include decimal

I expect the program to keep asking me the correct input until I enter an integer from 1 to 10

* For example
input: 12
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

input: 1.25
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

input: -1
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

input: 0
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

% Test case 3: input is a string of characters or numbers and characters together

I expect the program to keep asking me the correct input until I enter an integer from 1 to 10

* For example

input: a
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

               Choose your dishes:

input: asdfaT1234
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:
actual output: Please enter the dish's number again!
               Choose your dishes:

input: (nothing)
expected output: Please enter the dish's number again!
                 Choose your dishes:

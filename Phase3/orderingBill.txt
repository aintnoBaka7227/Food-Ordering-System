% this is a test file when i want to combine phase 2 and phase 3 together cause phase 3 is related directly to phase 2

% I have already tested different small code before combining together for these test file so i will focus only on if the code can work continuously through each phase and my ideal output is the check out menu where the order is displayed correctly.

% How I will test this combination: I still check on how the inputs ( both wrong and right) are handled and how the order's imformation is transmitted to phase 3 and display correctly

% Here is an example test case where I will order 2 "Vietnamese coffee" and 2 " Tiramisu". I will enter wrong inputs for both "dish" variable and "dishName" variables: decimal, negative, string of characters. However, my final output shoudld be a checkout with correct order. And during the running, there should be no crashes or delayed because of errors.

% test case:

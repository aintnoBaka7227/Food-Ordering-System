% This is a test file for phase 3: order check

% After Phase 2, I want to print out a check out window where customer can recheck their order.

% Here is my code:

% display order
disp("Ordering succesfully!")
fprintf("\n");
disp("|                  ___Here is your order___                  |    ")
disp("            Dish             Quantity          Price         ")
for ii=1:length(dishName)
    fprintf("%22s          %.0f              %.2f\n", dishName(ii),quantity(ii),dishTotalPrice(ii));  
end                
printf("\n");                                          
fprintf("           Total                              %.2f\n",totalCash);


% Here is an example test case 

input: dishName=["Vietnamese coffee" "French Toast"]
       quantity=[5 1]
       dishTotalPrice=[ 40.00 13.99 ]
       totalCash=53.99

expected output:

Ordering succesfully!

|                  ___Here is your order___                  |    
            Dish             Quantity          Price         
     Vietnamese coffee          5              40.00
          French Toast          1              13.99

           Total                              53.99

actual output:

Ordering succesfully!

|                  ___Here is your order___                  |    
            Dish             Quantity          Price         
     Vietnamese coffee          5              40.00
          French Toast          1              13.99

           Total                              53.99

% This is a test file for Phase 4: Checkout, Part 1: Print receipt or not ?

% I expect the program to keep asking for the right syntax until they enter "y" or "n" and display each comments related to "y" or "n"

% test case 1: right syntax "y" or "n"

input:y
expected output: Printing receipt...
actual output: Printing receipt...

input:n
expected output: Thank you for coming, Mr/Mrs %s, please enjoy your meal!
actual output: Thank you for coming, Mr/Mrs %s, please enjoy your meal!

% Test case 2: wrong syntax -numbers, other characters

input: 1
expected output: "Please enter the right systax!"
                 "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')
actual output: "Please enter the right systax!"
               "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')

input: a
expected output: "Please enter the right systax!"
                 "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')
actual output: "Please enter the right systax!"
               "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')

input: y 08734Rt
expected output: "Please enter the right systax!"
                 "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')
actual output: "Please enter the right systax!"
               "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')

input: (nothing)
expected output: "Please enter the right systax!"
                 "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')
actual output: "Please enter the right systax!"
               "Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')




% eventhough the code work well, I find out another problems is that when customer want to cancel their order or they enter 
wrong dishes, wrong quantities there is no way for them to cancel their order to choose again. So I wrore a while loop condition
outside the previous loop to check if customer want to cancel their order or not? I believed this development allow my program to 
be more personalized and better customer service.

% cancel order
stop=input("Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):","s");
while stop~="y" && stop~="n"
    disp("Please enter the right systax!")
    stop=input("Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):","s");
end


% the full fixed code:

% Part 1: Print receipt or not?
% cancel order?
stop=input("Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):","s");
while stop~="y" && stop~="n"
    disp("Please enter the right systax!")
    stop=input("Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):","s");
end
% cancel order
if stop=="y"
    disp("Canceling order!")
else
    % accept order 
    if stop=="n"
        % check user if they want bill or not
        check=input("Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')","s");
        % allow "y" for yes and "n" for no
        while check~="y" && check~="n"
            disp("Please enter the right systax!")
            check=input("Do you want a recipt? (Yes='y', No='n')","s");
        end
        % no receipt
        if check=="n"
            fprintf("Thank you for coming, Mr/Mrs %s, please enjoy your meal!\n",name)
        else
            %print receipt
            if check=="y"
                disp("Printing receipt...")
            end
       end
    end
end

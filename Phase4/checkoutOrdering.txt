% This is a test file for merging Phase 2: ordering and Phase 4: Checkout since they are linked directly without any technical related to Phase 3: Bill

% This test case is to check if my customer can order normally, and the order will be print out as a text file. There are several invalid inputs like negative numbers, decimal, wrong chracters to check if my code can handle those situation.


% What I expect is a receipt with correct details of the order and the total price 

This is an example test case for my program:

% I will order 3 "Latte", 2 "Ham  & Cheese Croissant", and print out receipt

% This is a test file for emerging Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 

% I want to check if the bill and the receipt match each others, or the order's detail is tramsmitted correctly from ordering to create a bill, and then print out the receipt. I focus mostly on the similar between bill and receipt, and how invalid inputs are handled.

% this is an example test case:

input: 
name: Gregormin
phone number: 000
dish:6
quantity:1
dish:7
quantity:1

expected output:

* bill

|                  ___Here is your order___                  |    
            Dish             Quantity          Price         
         Hot chocolate          1              10.50
              Tiramisu          1              11.50

           Total                              22.00

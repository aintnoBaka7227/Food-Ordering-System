% this is a test file for Phase 4: Checkout

% Since I have written test files for different small code, in this genereal test file I check how the code runs after emerging differents parts of the program together.

% I will check 4 test cases, 3 test case with valid inputs, one is cancel order, one is don't print receipt and the other is print receipt with correct order and total price , 
1 test case with invalids inputs for order matrixs. During inputting to answers questions, I will also add several wrongs inputs like numbers, wrong characters or string to check 
if my program can handle different wrong cases.


% Test case 1: correct input, cancel order 

input:
name="Paul";
phone="0981234567";
order=["Americano"                 "5"    "47.5"
        "Ham & Cheese Croissant"    "1"    "9.9" 
        "Cappuchino"                "2"    "21"];

expected output: Canceling order!

actual output: Canceling order!

%  What was displayed on console

Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):4
Please enter the right systax!
Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):k
Please enter the right systax!
Do you want to cancel your order? (Yes='y', No='n'):y
Canceling order!

% this test case prove my code can handle wrong inputs and output correct comments

% Test case 2: correct input, accept order, no receipt 

input:
name="Paul";
phone="0981234567";
order=["Americano"                 "5"    "47.5"
        "Ham & Cheese Croissant"    "1"    "9.9" 
        "Cappuchino"                "2"    "21"];

expected output:  Thank you for coming, Mr/Mrs Paul, please enjoy your meal!

% this prove my code works well with all conditions of inputs, and different expected outputs


% Test case 4: invalid inputs for orders while still checking code functionality to handle invalid inputs for both syntax and calculation

input:

phone="01278hh1h";
order=["Americano"                 "5"    "47.5a"

        "Cappuchino"                "2bv"    "21"];

% I expect the code still run dispite invalid inputs to check if the code can still run or not

% This prove my code still be able to handle wrong inputs and print out a text file receipt without any problems. This result is acceptable since my inputs for calculations are no numbers
so the program will listed them as "NaN" and print out "NaN" on the receipt.
